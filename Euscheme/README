            Euscheme: an implementation of EuLisp level 0.
                             (Mostly.)


Based on the xscheme sources of David Michael Betz, this is a mostly EuLisp
level 0 compliant interpreter (working from version 0.99 of the definition,
and some extras).  The usual applies: unrestricted non-commercial use,
you can't blame me for anything that goes wrong, and there are probably
bugs.

Installation:  look at the makefile, and use the appropriate set of flags.
Euscheme need two paths:  where to look for the compiled image, and
where to look for modules to load.

Image:  first euscheme checks the env variable EU_IMAGE_PATH (a colon
separated list of directory names), then a builtin path, set from
IMAGE_SEARCH_PATH in the Makefile.

Modules: ditto for env variable EU_MODULE_PATH, then builtin
MODULE_SEARCH_PATH (e.g., you might want to provide a set of system supplied
modules).

Bits:
The special form (!> foo) loads and enters the module foo.em.  Modules
can rename and filter on import (not yet on export).  Use level0.em
for all the basic stuff, e.g.,

(defmodule mymod
  (import (level0))
  ...
)

If you import no modules, you get nothing---not even special forms!  See
Modules/rename.em.

There are keywords (unbindable, unassignable, self-evaluating symbols), e.g.,
(defclass foo ()
  ((a default: 99
      keyword: a:
      accessor: foo-a))
  constructor: (make-foo a:))

Try (describe xx) for information on xx.
(class-hierarchy) to see all the classes.

Look at directory Modules for a few examples (the stuff in Boot uses a non-
eulisp syntax).
